# SpeedcamMining
Just some data mining on mobile speed camera data...

### DISCLAMER
This project is mainly for educational purposes, to learn something about data mining.
This project won't display when there certainly is a speed camera near you. It is supposed to collect statistical data only.
**All of this knowledge could also be acquired by pure experience.**

### Goals
These are examples of questions that could be interesing to answer:
- Has there never been a mobile speed camera in a specific area in the last x months?
- Where are most mobile speed cameras located?
- Are there weekdays where there are more or less mobile speed cameras?
- At which time of day are mobile speed cameras typically set up (actually reported by users) and removed?

There are also some advanced questions that might be interesting later:
- Can neural networks be used to make predictions when and were there will be an increased probability for mobile speed cameras?
- Are there any other patterns?
